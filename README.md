# Leetcode

---

This is my personal LeetCode practice starting from Jan 25, 2024. My goal is to prepare comprehensively for my Summer 2024 internship in the quantitative finance domain. Each solution is accompanied by my thought process, analysis, and the concepts I employed.

# Setup

1. Choose VS Code as IDE
2. Install plugin [vscode-leetcode](https://github.com/LeetCode-OpenSource/vscode-leetcode). 
   1. Login your LeetCode account
   2. It will automatically create a folder named “leetcode” in the local machine.
3. Upload the local repo on github: [Adding locally hosted code to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)
4. Install debug plugin [vscode-debug-leetcode](https://github.com/wangtao0101/vscode-debug-leetcode)
   - if we have `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9` as input then 
   - the input format should be like `[2,7,11,15]\n9`
5. Start!
